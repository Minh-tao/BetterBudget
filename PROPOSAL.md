# Project Proposal

## Statement
Our final project is a budgeting application that combines features from an ATM app, spending visualizer, and To-Do list. The goal of the application is to help users visualize their financial transactions, set saving goals, and make suggestions on where to reduce spending or allocate extra money. The application will showcase our proficiency in JavaFX, graphical user interfaces, and software design principles.

## Technical Outline
The project will utilize the following data structures and techniques:
- Classes and objects for managing transactions, accounts, and categories
- Hashmaps for storing Account data specifically.
- JavaFX components such as TableView, TabPane, PieChart, and Canvas for the user interface
- Trello for Project Management so we can create story maps and break the project down into small tasks.
- Loading and saving data to a .dat file
- Integration with GitHub for version control and collaboration

### Backend
- `Transaction` class representing a single transaction, with fields such as name, amount, date, and payment method
- `Account` class representing a user account, with fields such as account balance and transaction history
- `Category` class representing a spending category, with fields such as name and transactions

### Frontend
- Main window with tabs for switching between ATM and spending tracker features
- Budget tab with deposit, withdrawal, and transfer functionality
- Spending tracker tab with transaction history, spending visualization, and budgeting tools
